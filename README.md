# Real-Time Facial Expression Detection

This Python project captures video input from a webcam and uses facial expression recognition to detect and display emotions in real-time. It provides personalized feedback based on the detected emotion, using the **FER** and **DeepFace** libraries for robust emotion analysis.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Utilizes the FER and DeepFace models to detect facial expressions, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and neutrality.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays emotion-specific tips, providing users with positive reinforcement or coping suggestions.
- **Multi-Threaded Processing**: Uses threading to process frames concurrently for smooth real-time analysis.
- **OpenCV Integration**: Displays bounding boxes around detected faces and updates emotion data on the video feed.
